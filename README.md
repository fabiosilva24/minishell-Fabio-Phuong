🐚 Minishell: The Terminal Has Awakened
Welcome to Minishell, where the terminal isn't just a tool — it's a battlefield of logic, syntax, and brain-bending bugs. Forged from pure C, sleepless nights, and a hint of desperation, this shell is your loyal sidekick through the dark corridors of the Unix world.

🧙‍♂️ It parses.
⚔️ It executes.
🌀 It handles pipes and redirections like a wizard with a wand.

Whether you're summoning ls -la | grep magic or taming wild environment variables, Minishell is your personal gateway to mastering the art of low-level shellcraft. Forget boring bash clones — this one's handcrafted with love malloc.

Features:
✅ Command parsing with quote handling (yes, even the cursed ones)

✅ Redirections >, >>, <, and the elusive << (heredoc sorcery)

✅ Pipes | like you're a terminal DJ

✅ Environment variable expansion $USER style

✅ Built-in commands so powerful they bend reality (cd, echo, export, and friends)

✅ Error messages that gently (or not) remind you of your sins

“One shell to rule them all, one fork to find them,
One execve to bring them all, and in the prompt bind them.”
